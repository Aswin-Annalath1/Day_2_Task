1. Write a blog on difference between document and Window objects ?
  
   These two fundamental objects are crucial components of the Document Object Model (DOM) and play pivotal roles in shaping the structure and behavior of web pages.

 >>Document object :The Document object represents the entire HTML document loaded in a web browser. It serves as a gateway to the content within the document, enabling 
   developers to manipulate and interact with elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and forms. Essentially, the Document object acts as a container for all the elements
   that constitute a web page's content.

   >>Key Characteristics of the Document Object:

  * Structure Manipulation: The document object allows developers to access, modify, and manipulate the structure of the HTML document. You can select elements by their IDs,
    classes, tags, or other attributes using methods like"getElementById","getElementsByClassName","getElementsByTagName",and more.
  * Content Manipulation: With the document object, you can change the text content, attributes, and even the styling of HTML elements. It provides methods like textContent, 
    innerHTML, setAttribute, and style for achieving these tasks.
  * DOM Event Handling: The document object facilitates event handling by allowing you to attach event listeners to specific elements. This enables interactive and dynamic web
    experiences through functions like addEventListener.

  >>Window Object : The window object represents the browser window or tab that displays the web page. It provides a global context for executing JavaScript code and offers 
    various methods and properties related to the browser window.

   >>Key Characteristics and Functions of Window Object:

  * Global Context: The window object serves as the global context for JavaScript code running within a browser. Variables and functions declared without a specific scope 
    become properties of the window object, making them accessible from anywhere in the script.
  * Browser Interaction: The window object provides methods to manipulate the browser itself, such as opening new windows or tabs using window.open, resizing the current 
    window, and navigating the browsing history with window.history.
  * Timers and Intervals: Developers can use the window object to set timers and intervals for executing functions at specific intervals. The setTimeout and setInterval 
    functions are part of the window object.
  * Browser Information: Information about the browser and the viewport can be accessed through the window object. Properties like window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, and 
    window.location provide details about the browser's dimensions and the current URL.

  >> In conclusion the  understanding of the document and window objects is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. The document object acts as a gateway to 
     the content and structure of the HTML document, enabling manipulation and interaction with elements. On the other hand, the window object serves as the browser's global 
     context, offering control over browser behavior, interaction, and script execution.
